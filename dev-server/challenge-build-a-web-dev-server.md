## 💻 Dev Challenge of the Day: Build Your Own Dev Server

Developer training (like LHL) rarely talks much about your **developer environment** — aside from “install this, install that, and you’re ready to go.” But what if you’re juggling web, desktop, mobile, game dev, SPFx work, or projects with conflicting dependencies?

---

### Today’s challenge:

* Set up a basic development server (old PC, Raspberry Pi, or small cloud VM).
* Install a clean OS (Linux, Windows Server — your choice).
* Enable remote access (SSH or RDP).
* Move one of your active projects onto it.
* Work on it remotely from your main machine.

---

### Why it matters:

* **Core DevOps skill** – Environment consistency, reproducibility, and team collaboration.
* **Anywhere access** – Your tools and code are always available.
* **Cleaner workflow** – Keep experiments off your personal machine.
* **Pro-level credibility** – Hiring managers love seeing you can manage real-world dev setups.

---

### Goal:

Experience the benefits of a central, always-on environment you can access from anywhere — and take your workflow one big step closer to how modern DevOps teams work.
